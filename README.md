# A very simple API to manage subscribers in your mysql database. 

The enviroment runs with Laradock, that is a Docker configuration of images built for Laravel.

You can Store, Retrive, Update and Delete Subscribers.


### Instructions

To run the enviroment you need to install Docker on your machine:
https://www.docker.com/

After this you need to clone this repo in a local folder:

`git clone https://github.com/romme86/HAFNC.git`

Than you have to go **inside the project directory** and clone Laradock:

`git clone https://github.com/Laradock/laradock.git`

Than you must enter the laradock folder inside the project and run:

`docker-compose up -d nginx mysql phpmyadmin workspace`

And it's up!
(yes it runs on nginx not apache2)

pretty neat uh?
i configured this laradock installation to use mysql 5 because the new 8 version is giving a bug on the password authentication method.

### TESTING

in the files you can see:

**"subscribers.postman_collection.json"**

you can import this in your Postman UI to execute the commands and test the code.
I did started building the testing environment with laravel
but i had to install phpunit and i was getting bugs and the time was running out for the deadline so... you can test with postman =)
